## Features

***Downsampling***: Hear what input audio would sound like if it were resampled at a lower rate.

***Vinyl Noise***: Add in a vinyl crackle effect to your mix for that vintage sound. Adjustable volume.

***Pre/Post Filter Customization***: Toggleable low pass filters before and after main effects are applied gives the user the option to minimize aliasing.

***Bit Depth Control***: Simulate the "quantization noise" characteristic of popular audio formats including CD, DVD, early digital audio, or telephony.

***Randomizer/Presets (planned)***: Switch to tailored ALF presets that most accurately simulate the sound quality of a specific format, or randomize parameters to make something entirely new.
