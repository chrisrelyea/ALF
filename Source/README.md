# ALF 
ALF (All-Purpose Lo-fi Funhouse) is a VST3/AU plugin that gives the user the tools they need to experiment with classic lo-fi audio effects.

Created by Chris Relyea, 2024, made with JUCE.

## Features

***Bitcrusher***: Allows for decimation (manual lowering of sample rate) down to a target kHz value.

***Vinyl Noise***: Add in a vinyl crackle effect to your mix for that vintage sound. Adjustable volume.

***Pre/Post Filter Customization***: Toggleable low pass filters before and after main effects are applied gives the user the option to minimize aliasing.

***Bit Depth Control (planned)***: Simulate the "quantization noise" characteristic of popular audio formats including CD, DVD, early digital audio, or telephony.

***Randomizer/Presets (planned)***: Switch to tailored ALF presets that most accurately simulate the sound quality of a specific format, or randomize parameters to make something entirely new.
